# selling-car-price-prediction-model
WELCOME TO MY MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT 

* This project involves creating a machine learning model to predict the selling price of a second-hand car based on various input features. The project includes both a backend (machine learning model) and a frontend (Graphical User Interface using Tkinter).
Load and Prepare the Dataset:

1.Load the dataset using pandas.
2.Prepare features for model training.
3. Train the Model:

4.Train a linear regression model using the prepared features and target variable.
5.Build the GUI:

6.Create a Tkinter window.
7.Add labels and entry fields for user inputs.
8.Add buttons for predicting the price and displaying the dataset.
9.Display the predicted price in a message box.



  
* Load and Prepare Data: Load the dataset, drop unnecessary columns, encode categorical features, and prepare the final set of features.
* Train the Model: Train a linear regression model using the prepared features and target variable.
* Build the GUI: Create a user interface with labels, entry fields, and buttons using Tkinter. Include functions to display the dataset and predict the selling price.
* Interactive Predictions: Allow users to input car details and get a predicted selling price.
